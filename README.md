# Python-Challenge
Python analysis of bank and polling data

## PyBank Instructions
In the first part of the challenge, I was told to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of my company. I was given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv, which is under the Resource folder in my Pybank folder. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

I created a Python script that analyzed the records and calculated each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
 
 Below is a screesnhot of my analysis:

To get a detailed look at my script, please visit the Pybank folder, and click on the PyBankMain.py file.

## PyPoll Instructions
In the second part of the challenge, I was told to analyze election data from a small rural town.
the data I analyzed was called election_data.csv, which is under the Resources folder in my PyPoll folder. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

I created a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote
